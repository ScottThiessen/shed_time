      Shed Time is an online practice log to help musicians maximize their practice time. Once registered, aspiring musicians can browse our library of exercises and get shedding. On our stats page, users will be able to see how long they worked on specific exercises, the date they worked on it, and how many times they completed it. Utilizing this data allows our users to pinpoint precisely what they need to spend time on, and what they don't so they can get to that next level in the most efficient way possible.<p>
